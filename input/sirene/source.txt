TEFEN: the size of the company's workforce

# Siren
Nine-digit identifying number assigned by Insee to all natural persons or corporate bodies recorded in the register of enterprises and establishments
# Sirene
Computer system for the register of enterprises and their establishments from which Insee creates the Sirene® database

# Siret
The Siret number is a unique identification number attributed to each establishment by Insee. 
It is simply a sequential number, made up of 14 non-significant digits:  the first nine digits correspond to the Siren number of the enterprise on which the establishment depends and the last five to an internal classification number (NIC).

A enterprise is made up of as many establishments as there are different places where it carries out its activities. The establishment closes when activity ceases in the establishment concerned or when it has a change of address.

# Principal activity (APE)

As part of its responsibility to maintain the Sirene register, Insee assigns a principal activity code (APE) for statistical purposes to the enterprise and to each of its establishments, based on the French Classification of Activities (NAF) as defined by decree.

The APE is determined separately for: 
- the enterprise as a whole and 
- for each establishment (based on a breakdown of the enterprise's activities).

#  Legal category

The legal category describes the legal status of the enterprise. 
For corporate bodies it is determined from the declaration completed when the enterprise is created. .

In the Sirene® database, legal nature corresponds only to the legal category for corporate bodies.

# activitePrincipaleUniteLegale - MainUnitLegalActivity- Main activity of the legal unit

At the time of its registration in the register, INSEE assigns to each legal unit a code called "APE" on the basis of the description of the main activity made by the declarant. This code can be modified during the life of the legal unit according to the declarations made by the operator.

For each legal unit, there is at a given time only one "APE" code. It is assigned according to the nomenclature in force. The nomenclature in force is the Naf Rév2 and this since January 1st, 2008. Each code consists of 2 digits, a dot, 2 digits and a letter. All legal units active on 01/01/2008 have had their APE code recoded in the new nomenclature, so many companies have a period starting on this date.
At the time of the company's declaration, it may happen that Insee is not able to assign the right APE code: the 00.00Z modality can then be provisionally assigned.
